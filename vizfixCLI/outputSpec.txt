All lines prepended with timestamp in milliseconds starting from 0.
All x,y coordinates are in screen coordinates.
All times are in milliseconds.

Sound IDs (as text) will be one of:
      Classify
      ClassifyError
      ClassifySuccess
      Neutral
      Hostile
      KeyboardError
      TimingError

Classify errors (as a number) will be one of:
      0 - no error
      1 - incorrect classification
      2 - keyboard timeout
      3 - invalid keystroke
      4 - no classification
      5 - gaze error, i.e. the P was looking at the tactical display when the sound was played
                           [Added post hoc, during the import of data into VizFixX. Does not apply to DualTask output data files.]
      6 - Classified while black (i.e. too early)
      7 - Classified after blip disappeared [Needs verification]
      8 - Classified while white (i.e. too late)

Blip designation:
      1 - Neutral
      2 - Hostile

Blip color (used in BlipMoved and BlipDisappeared):
      0 - Black
      1 - Green
      2 - Red
      5 - White
      7 - Yellow

Blip type
	  1 - Fighter;
	  2 - Support;
	  3 - Missile;

Blip designation (used in BlipAppeared):
     1 - Neutral (i.e. green)
     2 - Hostile (i.e. red)

Sensor Failure (used in BlipAppeared):
     0 - No failure (i.e. blip will become green or red)
     1 - Failure (i.e. blip will become yellow)

Types of data output:


EyeGaze
=======
   <sample #> <x pos> <y pos> < [0|1] - whether eye found >


Sound
=====
   <x pos> <y pos> <sound id> [<error description if unsuccessful>]


SoundOff
========
   <sound id> [<error description if unsuccessful>]


Keyboard
========
   <key character> < [1|2] - first or second keystroke > <Classify error>

	Note that the classify error is only significant for the second keystroke
	or if the first keystroke is 'Hostile' or 'Neutral', which is an error.


ClassifyData
============
   <# correct classifications> <# incorrect classifications> <percent correct>


TrialData
=========
   <blip id> <time blip appeared> <time from blip appear to first gaze at tactical display> <time blip changed color>
                        <time from blip appear to first keypress> <time from blip appear to second keypress> <classify error>

BlipAppeared
============
   <blip id> <x pos> <y pos> <blip type> <blip designation> <sensor will fail> <speed/100> <angle> <blip track #>
