# VizFix

A Research Tool For Visualizing Eye Movement Data.

## 9/22/2015
Note that there is a branch for dual task, which uses the old data model, and should be checked out for building the dual task version.

The breaking difference between the main branch and the dual task branch is that in the dual task branch, a fixation's fixated AOI is recorded with a string, whereas in the main branch, the fixated AOI is a VisualStimulusFrame object.

A dual task version is checked out as VizFix_for_Dualtask.zip.
